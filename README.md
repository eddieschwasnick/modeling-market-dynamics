# Modeling Market Dynamics as Stochastic Processes on Curved Manifolds
*Inspired by Jim Simons' concept of holonomy from "The Man Who Solved the Market" by Gregory Zuckerman*
## Background to my Inspiration
Growing up, I loved the idea of owning your job by day trading — starting from nothing and trying to build something real with just discipline and focus. I tried all kinds of strategies — EMA crossovers, VWAP signals, combining technical setups with strong earnings — but I still saw trades fail for reasons I couldn’t explain. Everything would point in the right direction, and the stock would still tank.

Reading about holonomy in *The Man Who Solved the Market* made something click: maybe the market doesn’t move in a straight line. Maybe it curves, and that curve is shaped by all kinds of forces we don’t directly see, such as technical, fundamental, macro, even psychological. Holonomy helped me put a math word to something I already felt — that trades can drift off course as they move through this complex space.

Now I want to model that. I’m building a framework that treats the market as a path through a curved space, shaped by different indicators and macro data. I’ll simulate price paths under different types of “curvature” and compare them to standard Brownian motion models. Basically: can I turn this gut feeling I’ve had for years into something concrete and testable?
